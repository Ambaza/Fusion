## Future Potential

This application has the potential to evolve in several ways:

- **Minimalist Dashboard**: The project can be expanded to create a minimalist dashboard that presents the most important insights from the merged Excel files. This dashboard could provide a quick overview of the data and help users make informed decisions more efficiently.

- **Improving Decision-Making**: The application can be enhanced to assist users in making both short-term and long-term decisions. This could involve the integration of data analysis and visualization tools to provide valuable insights.

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to help realize the full potential of this project.
